<p>"The Albin Countergambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. d4 d5. 2. c4 e5. and the usual continuation is: 3. dxe5 d4. The opening is a gambit and an uncommon response to the Queen's Gambit. In exchange for the sacrificed pawn, Black has a central wedge at d4 and gets some chances for an attack." </p>

<p>"The Albin Counter-Gambit, as suggested by its name, is employed by the black pieces. Any gambit is an initial sacrifice offered normally by white in the opening and most counter gambits are offered by black against white's gambits.

<p>"The Albin Counter-Gambit is a response to the Queen's Gambit, begging with the moves 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5. In the Albin Counter-Gambit, black immediately strikes back against white's space advantage in the center by thrusting their king's pawn forward - even at the cost of a pawn! Declining this pawn sacrifice doesn't make much sense." </p>

<p>"In the Albin Counter Gambit, white is confronted with a dilemma between two options. Ignoring the gambit is a form of concession, allowing black to capitalize on their early strike at the center. On the other hand, accepting the gambit leads to an original and uncommon middlegame structure that can disrupt the natural development of minor pieces." </p>

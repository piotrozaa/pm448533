<p>"The Elephant Gambit (also called the Queen's Pawn Countergambit or Englund Counterattack) is a rarely played chess opening beginning with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5 ?! The Elephant Gambit is generally considered unsound, with black typically unable to gain compensation for the sacrificed pawn." </p>

<p>"Quick overview. The Elephant Gambit is a rare opening arising after the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d5. Black's idea is to take White out of preparation and to undermine the center. If White plays inaccurately, Black can make things uncomfortable for White. White can easily refute the gambit though by capturing the pawn." </p>

<p>"The Elephant Gambit is a rare response to the King's Pawn Opening - and it's rare for a reason! The opening is characterized by the first moves 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5?! Black's attempt to grab the full center could be seen as ambitious, but black simply doesn't have the development needed to justify this pawn thrust." </p>

<p>"The main goal of the Elephant Gambit is to dislodge White's minor pieces and expand at the center of the board. To do that, Black sacrifices a pawn to strike with the typical e4-pawn push. White can stay active, utilize their Queen and f3-Knight, and prevail with a material advantage or positional edge." </p>

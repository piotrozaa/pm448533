<p>"Scotch Gambit. The Scotch Gambit is a popular, aggressive continuation white can select after playing the Scotch Game. The opening moves are 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Bc4. Rather than recapturing the pawn on d4, white uses his fourth move to develop a bishop actively and take aim at the f7 square!" </p>

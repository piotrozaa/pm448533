<p>"Black has just one piece developed while White has three. Benko Gambit. The Benko Gambit is a line of the Benoni Defense that begins with the moves 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5.

<p>"Perhaps not a true three pawn gambit as theory recommends returning the third pawn with 7... d5! for Black, but should Black try to hold on to all three pawns the complications favor white ...

<p>"The Lolli Attack is an aggressive opening for white in the Italian game when black defends with the two knights defense. Instead of immediately sacrificing the knight on f7, white instead plays d4, sacrificing another pawn and then castling kingside. 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5" </p>

<p>"The Lolli Attack is an extremely aggressive line for white in the two knights defense against the Italian Game. It is very similar to the Fried Liver Attack..." </p>

<p>"In this particular line of the Italian Game, Black's immediate of the recapture of the d5 pawn is generally considered to be ill-advised (as many beginners have found out the hard way!). To initiate the Lolli Attack, white delays the well-known piece sacrifice (6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7. Qf3+) in favor of blowing open more lines in the center with 6. d4." </p>

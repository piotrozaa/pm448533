<p>"The lesser-known Tennison Gambit is initiated with the seemingly calm and collected starting move of the Reti Opening, 1.Nf3, but the Flank Opening takes a surprising turn after 1â€¦d5 with the move 2.e4.This opening bears resemblance to the Englund Gambit played by black, but with reversed colors. The key difference is that white utilizes the extra tempo gained by developing the knight to f3." </p>

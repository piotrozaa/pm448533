<p>"In the Scandinavian Defense (also known as Center-Counter Defense), 1. e4 is replied by a daring 1…d5 by black in order to obtain central control instantly, and the capture of the d5-pawn (2. exd5) is often replied by 2…Qxd5 (Main Line), which almost provokes white to play 3. Nc3, attacking the queen, and letting white develop a piece with a tempo." </p>
